This repo contains some fun and useful GUI Python projects made with Tkinter, a standard library for creating graphical user interfaces. These projects are:

- A clicker game that counts how many times you can click a button in a given time
- A pomodoro timer that helps you manage your work and break sessions
- A countdown timer that displays the remaining time for a certain event
- A GPA calculator that calculates your grade point average based on your grades and credits
- A number guessing game that challenges you to guess a random number

## Installation

To run these projects, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to have Tkinter installed, which is usually included with Python. If not, you can install it using pip: pip install tkinter
